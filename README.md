</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a clone of Netflix website built using <strong><em>Vanilla JavaScript</em></strong> as a Front-end . It's not a replica, and it     doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in Front-end Developement to build something advanced       like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and Payment page.
